## üëâ CDN

Anybody can get started with Trim by inserting the following above the `</head>` tag.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/501A-Designs/Trim/index.js" defer></script>
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/501A-Designs/Trim/css/cssVariables.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/501A-Designs/Trim/css/trim.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Each webcomponent is saved in seperate files. To access a specific webcomponent, use the CDN below while referencing the JavaScript file name.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/501A-Designs/Trim/components/<component-file-name>" defer></script>
```

In addition to using the webcomponents it is necessary to use the CDN below. Because all components use CSS variables this gives the general styling to all the components. You may fork and edit it to your preference as well.

```html
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/501A-Designs/Trim/css/cssVariables.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Optional:
You can also insert the Palette CDN which will enable you to easily add color via `class`:

```html
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/501A-Designs/Palette/Palette.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

### üìÉ Styled Ordered Lists:

Adding the `id` with the names below will enable you to add styles to the number of your ordered list (Ordered list are use numerical values).

| Id Name      | List Style                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| ol-round     | Adds a circle around the number        |
| ol-capsule   | Adds a capsule shape around the number |
| ol-rectangle | Adds a rectangle around the number     |
| ol-square    | Adds a square around the number        |

_Add the id's to the `ol` tag_

You can also additionally style the color of the numbers and background by adding the `::before` pseudo class to your `id`'s `li` tag.

Example:
`ol-round li::before`

<a name="sg"></a>

### üî≥ Simple Grid:

You can use CSS grid by simply adding `grid-1fr-1fr-1fr...` as a class to a component. However, this grid can only support up to 6 columns at max (`grid-1fr-1fr-1fr-1fr-1fr-1fr`). Note: If you add the `section` tag as a child component of the Simple Grid class, it will be formatted into a Content Card (Grid Content Card). You can also use the `grid-auto` class, which will create a grid that is automatically laid out depending on the number of components you have.

### üîõ Simple Flex Box:

You can create a CSS flex box by adding the following class names to any parent component. All flex properties have a flex-direction of `row`. Variations include the following:

| Class Name    | Flex Property            |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| flex-standard | No Assigned Property     |
| flex-right    | justify-content: right;  |
| flex-center   | justify-content: center; |
| flex-left     | justify-content: left;   |

<a name="hvr"></a>

### ‚òù Hover:

Hover is initiated using the `:hover` pseudo element. Writing the `hover-classname` as a class name enables the object an effect when hovered.

| Class Name     | Effect on hover          |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| hover-rotation | Rotates in 3D            |
| hover-scale    | Scales                   |
| hover-opacity  | Lowers Opacity           |
| hover-blur     | Blurs                    |
| hover-arrow    | Adds an arrow at the end |

_Best works with Grid Content Card. `hover-arrow` works best with buttons_

<a name="load"></a>

### üîÉ Load:

The `load-effectname` class will be enabled when the webpage has loaded. This component is good for when you want to create page transitions, or when creating simple drawers with animations.

| Class Name | Effect on load                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| load-wave  | Shows content with a radiating circle |
| load-open  | Shows content from top to bottom      |
| load-drop  | Drops content one after another       |

_`wave` and `open` best work with the `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML tags._

v1.7 now supports the `load-animation` web component. You can change the color of the animating object using the `objColor` property.
